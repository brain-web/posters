# posters
Poster walls and rooms from meetings present and past.

In the **posterrooms** each square represents a poster. Green squares show in real-time active posters and the number indicates how many participants are connected. On the **posterwall**, all posters are shown in one view, with fast zoom and coordinates to link to one specififc poster.  
The BrainWeb aims at providing a permanent space for meeting and hacking, available all year round. The posters will have a permanent life here.
